# Customer-churn-prediction-Shanza-Mumtaz-
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, as losing customers can impact revenue and growth. 
Description:

By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to maintain a loyal customer base.

The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as age, total purchases, account management status, years with the company, number of sites, onboarding date, location, company name, and whether the customer churned. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure it is ready for analysis, exploring the data to understand patterns and relationships, and training a machine learning model to make predictions.

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, and visualizations are created to provide a clear understanding of the results. The insights gained from this project can help businesses identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention. This project demonstrates the value of data analysis and machine learning in addressing real-world business challenges.

Introduction

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to maintain a healthy customer base. This project uses a dataset which is used to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on various features.

Dataset

The dataset includes customer information such as age, total purchases, account management status, years with the company, number of sites, onboarding date, location, company name, and whether the customer churned.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, understanding data distributions, and exploring relationships between variables.

Model Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

Requirements

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Results

Visualizations such as the confusion matrix and feature importance plot provide insights into the model's performance and the significance of various features.

Conclusion

The project successfully developed a predictive model for customer churn, highlighting the importance of factors like total purchases and years with the company in predicting churn.
